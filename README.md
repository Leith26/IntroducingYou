# Introducing-Leith-Bader

My name is _Leith Bader_ and I was born in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario. But 11/14 years of my life, I lived in Ottawa, Ontario. I spent two years of my life in Toronto and 1 year in Beijing, China. 

### **Middle school & family:**  
I went to [_W.O.Mitchell elementary school_](https://womitchelles.ocdsb.ca/Pages/home.aspx). Not the **biggest** school but it was a big part of my life. My _family_ consists of my mom, my dad, my little sister and my older sibling. My parents divorced when I was in grade 1 so I have two houses. I switch houses every week! My little sister's name is Vivienne and my older sibling's name is Simone or Danny.

### **Hobbies:**  
I like to play hockey outside of schol but I'm not competitive. I love to read and watch movies! And I love to swim and go to amusement parks. Finally, I watch my favourite hockey team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs.

### **Favourite things:**  
I **LOVE** music and singing. I can't narrow down a favourite song or artist because there are so many! But my favourite type of music is Pop and my favourite band (not artist} is Mariana's Trench. I also love movies. I don't think I can pick one favourite but I like the Harry Potter movies and the pitch perfect movies. My favourite actress is Emma Watson and actor is Daniel Radcliffe. Finally my favourite food is Indian food, because I love spicy foods a lot and naan bread. 

### **Strengths and weaknesses:**  
A strength of mine is that i'm a pretty fast learner and I don't take anything personally. But a weakness of mine is that even though I love to play most sports but I'm not very athletic.

### **Languages and Jokes:**  
I speak english and french. I also know a few scattered words in other languages. My favourite clean joke is "all pro athletes speak two languages, englisha and profanity".

### **Weekends:**  
My weekend is typically lazy. I like to chill on the couch and enjoy not having to do work. I also like to hang with friends and not worry about anything else.

### **My BTT10 course and softwares I've used:**  
I want to be asked a question in the future about computers or coding and be able to answer the question with confidance because I learned it in BTT10. In the past I have used different softwares like Microsoft word, google drive, and others.

### **Other things about me:**  
Here are a few places I've been in my life:
 * China (1 year)
 * Tunisia (few weeks)
 * Toronto (at least once a year)
 * Niagra Falls 
 * Vancouver (over night)
 * And others!
 
 This is me, Leith Bader!
