# Introducing-Leith-Bader

My name is _Leith Bader_ and I was born in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario. But 11/14 years of my life, I lived in Ottawa, Ontario. I spent two years of my life in Toronto and 1 year in Beijing, China. 

**Middle school & family:**
I went to [_W.O.Mitchell elementary school_](https://womitchelles.ocdsb.ca/Pages/home.aspx). Not the **biggest** school but it was a big part of my life. My _family_ consists of my mom, my dad, my little sister and my older sibling. My parents divorced when I was in grade 1 so I have two houses. I switch houses every week! My little sister's name is Vivienne and my older sibling's name is Simone or Danny.

**Hobbies**
I like to playb hockey outside of schol but I'm not competitive. I love to read and watch movies! And finally I love to swim and go to amusement parks.

**Favourite things**
I **LOVE** music and singing. I can't narrow down a favourite song or artist because there are so many! But my favourite type of music is Pop and my favourite band (not artist} is Mariana's Trench.
